merde-bot is a GitHub bot that helps with merge conflicts.

If you mention `@merde-bot` in a PR that cannot be merged due to conflicts, the bot will try to help out. (No guarantees. And it can take a while, like many minutes.)

It is made by [merde.ai](https://merde.ai), where you can get the same conflict resolution, but in a more convenient, local command-line form.

This is the public issue tracker for merde-bot and the broader merde conflict resolution service.
